# Keras: From CNN foundations to Deep learning framework

Introduction to Big Data course – fit@hcmus  
Updated: May 26, 2024  

## Introduction  

This is our teamwork for the *Introduction to Big Data* course, where we explore **Keras**, a high-level and user-friendly deep learning framework that runs on **TensorFlow**, **JAX**, and **PyTorch** backends.  

The report introduces **deep learning through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** — starting from the basic concepts and intuition, and moving toward the **MNIST handwritten digit classification** example. This serves both as theoretical grounding and as a practical demonstration for understanding Keras’ power and simplicity.  

## Contents

### 1. Problem Statement  

This section introduces deep learning by explaining the intuition behind **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, inspired by the human visual system. It covers the structure and role of key CNN layers such as convolution, pooling, and dense layers, illustrating how they process images hierarchically to detect patterns and objects.  

The **MNIST handwritten digit classification** task is then used as a practical example to connect theory with implementation.  

### 2. Keras History and Development  
This section traces Keras from its creation by **François Chollet** to its growth under **Google**, highlighting its simplicity, flexibility, and popularity compared to TensorFlow and PyTorch. We also mention Keras’s widespread use in both research and industry.  

### 3. Keras Architecture  
We introduce how models are built in Keras using **Sequential**, **Functional**, and **Subclassing APIs**, along with new features in **Keras 3.0**, such as cross-backend support and `keras.ops` for unified operations across TensorFlow, JAX, and PyTorch.  

### 4. Demonstration  
We implement a **CNN for MNIST digit classification** using Keras, showing data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. Finally, we extend the project with an **OpenCV-based app** that allows users to draw digits and receive instant predictions from the trained model.
